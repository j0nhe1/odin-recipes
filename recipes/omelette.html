        <ol>
            <li>Crack the eggs and then place in a medium bowl. Add the salt and pepper and then beat using a wire whisk or fork. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the cooking oil in a pan. Saute the onion and tomatoes for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour-in the beaten egg mixture. Spread the mixture by tilting the pan sideways. Continue to cook in medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the omelet with the aid of a wide spatula and then cook the other side for 3 minutes. Note: If you are having a hard time flipping the omelet, try to first place the egg on a wide plate (the cooked side should be facing down). Quickly flip the plate on top of the pan so that the omelet will slide to the pan with the uncooked side facing down./li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and then transfer the omelet to a serving plate. Enjoy with pandesal or garlic rice. Serve with banana ketchup.</li>
